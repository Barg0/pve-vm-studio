.SYNOPSIS
    Guest-side provisioner injected by Build-Vms.ps1.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs once at the end of Windows Setup (SetupComplete) to finish online work
    that cannot be done offline: leftover Windows features, Client RSAT when no
    FoD source was available, Azure Arc onboarding (service-principal mode), and -
    for VMs with domainJoin.mode = "deferred" - sealing the join credential and
    registering the VmDeploy-DomainJoin task that joins after Setup is done.

# The blue band a compiled cmdlet paints across the top of the console -
# Add-WindowsCapability, Convert-VHD, Optimize-VHD and the rest. It steals rows,
# scrolls the buffer under a menu that has parked its cursor, and looks nothing like
# anything else this script writes. Every operation that draws one is logged before
# and after it, so nothing is lost by turning it off.
#
# It is also a speed win: on Windows PowerShell 5.1 the host repaints that band far
# more often than the work warrants, and for a chunked read the console I/O dominates
# - which is why Invoke-WebRequest is not used for the image download either.
#
# Replacing it with this project's own bar was researched and dropped; the findings
# are in .claude\progress-panel-research.md rather than in code.
#
# GLOBAL, not script scope. Most cmdlets resolve a preference variable by walking the
# caller's scope and would see either, but the Storage module's cmdlets are CDXML -
# generated wrappers over CIM - and Format-Volume was still painting its band with the
# script-scoped form. The global is the scope every lookup ends at, so it is the one
# that reaches all of them. These scripts own their process and exit at the end, so
# there is nothing to restore it for.
